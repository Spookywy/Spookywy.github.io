Hello 👋 my name is Valentin Menoret.

I am a 25 years old software engineer with a passion for new technologies and a strong desire to constantly improve my craft.

I graduated from 🎓[IMT Atlantique] in 2022 with a master's degree in software engineering.

I'm always eager to learn and collaborate with other enthusiasts while working on interesting and meaningful projects 👨🏻‍💻.
